- **Dropdown selector** for easy switching

### 📈 Statistics Panel
- **Visual stats dashboard** showing:
  - Total notes count
  - Pending notes count
  - Completed notes count
- **Interactive stat cards** with hover effects
- **Real-time updates** as notes change

### ♿ Accessibility Improvements
- **Comprehensive ARIA labels** and roles
- **Keyboard navigation support**:
  - Tab through all interactive elements
  - Arrow keys for filter navigation
  - Enter/Escape for form interactions
  - Ctrl/Cmd shortcuts for quick access
- **Focus indicators** with consistent styling
- **Screen reader friendly** announcements
- **Semantic HTML** structure with proper roles

### 🏗️ Code Architecture
- **Extracted storage module** for better separation of concerns
- **Pure functions** for easier testing and maintainability
- **TypeScript interfaces** for type safety
- **Comprehensive error handling** for localStorage operations
- **Consistent code structure** between JS and TS versions

### 🧪 Unit Testing (TypeScript)
- **Comprehensive test suite** with 31 passing tests
- **Vitest framework** for modern, fast testing
- **100% coverage** of storage module functions:
  - Note creation and manipulation
  - Search and filtering logic
  - Sorting algorithms
  - Statistics calculations
  - localStorage integration with error handling
- **Mocked dependencies** (localStorage, crypto.randomUUID)
- **Edge case testing** for robust error handling

## 🎹 Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl/Cmd + N**: Focus new note input
- **Ctrl/Cmd + K**: Focus search input
- **Enter**: Add new note (when in input field)
- **Escape**: Clear input field
- **Tab/Shift+Tab**: Navigate between elements
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate between filter buttons
- **Space/Enter**: Activate buttons and filters

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Applications

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Storage Module Functions
- `loadNotes()` - Load notes from localStorage with error handling
- `saveNotes(notes)` - Save notes to localStorage with error handling
- `createNote(text)` - Create new note with UUID and timestamp
- `toggleNote(note)` - Toggle completion status immutably
- `searchNotes(notes, query)` - Filter notes by text content
- `sortNotes(notes, sortBy)` - Sort notes by various criteria
- `filterNotesByStatus(notes, filter)` - Filter by completion status
- `calculateStats(notes)` - Generate statistics for dashboard

### Styling Approach
- **CSS-in-JS** using React's inline styles for component encapsulation
- **CSS animations** defined in `<style>` blocks for complex animations
- **Responsive design** using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Modern color palette** with gradients and subtle transparency
- **Consistent spacing** using rem units for accessibility

### State Management
- **React hooks** for all state management (useState, useEffect, useMemo)
- **Optimized re-renders** using useMemo for expensive computations
- **Immutable updates** for all state changes
- **Persistent storage** with automatic localStorage synchronization

## 🎯 Comparison Features

Both versions implement identical functionality to enable direct comparison between JavaScript and TypeScript approaches:

- Same UI/UX design and animations
- Identical feature set and behavior
- Similar code structure and patterns
- Equivalent accessibility features
- Same keyboard shortcuts and interactions

The main differences are:
- **Type safety** in TypeScript version
- **Interface definitions** for data structures
- **Enhanced IDE support** with TypeScript
- **Unit tests** available only in TypeScript version
- **Better error catching** at compile time with TypeScript

## 🌟 User Experience Highlights

1. **Instant feedback** - All actions provide immediate visual feedback
2. **Smooth interactions** - Animations make the app feel responsive and polished
3. **Keyboard-friendly** - Full keyboard navigation support for power users
4. **Visual hierarchy** - Clear information architecture with stats, controls, and content
5. **Contextual help** - Placeholder text includes keyboard shortcuts
6. **Error resilience** - Graceful handling of localStorage issues
7. **Progressive enhancement** - Core functionality works even if animations fail

This modernized notes app demonstrates best practices in React development, accessibility, testing, and user experience design while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase.
